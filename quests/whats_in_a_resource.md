# What's in a resource?

For Puppet, anything on your system you might want to manage can be represented
as a resource. Puppet has built-in resource types to cover most aspects of a
system an administrator might care about. Some of the most common resource
types are `file`, `package`, `user`, and `service`.

Puppet modules allow you to write your own resource types or use those already
created by the community. You can use custom resources to manage more complex
and specific systems like a postgres database or an Apache virtual host.

## Resource syntax

Use the `puppet resource` tool to look at a `file` resource on your system. In
the terminal to the right, enter the following command:

    puppet resource file /var/www/html/hello_puppet.html

The block of you see is called a resource declarationâ€”it's how Puppet sees the
world. Resource declarations have a common syntax no matter what you want to
manage and what operating system you're working on.

    type { 'title':
      parameter => 'value',
    }
      
Your file resource only has one parameter value pair: `ensure => absent`. The
`ensure` parameter expresses the basic state of the resource. In this case, the
`absent` value means that the file specified by the resource title doesn't
exist.

Continue on to the next task, and you'll see how to create this file by
modifying the resource declaration.
